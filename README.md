# Coin-Flip---C-

The program has a function that will simulate a coin flip. To act as "heads" and "tails" we have integers 1 and 2, which are generated randomly by the computer. Whichever number the computer generates determines whether the console outputs "heads" or "tails". Furthermore, the program is written for a user to give input to the program. This input will be to guess which of the two randomly generated numbers the computer will output. If the user guesses the number correctly, the user will gain one point. If the user is incorrect, the computer will gain one point. The score of the user and the computer will be recorded when the user decides not to play another game.
